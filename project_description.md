# Project Description - lifx-rs

## Summary of Work

This is a Rust library for communicating with LIFX smart lights through both the official LIFX API and an unofficial offline API.

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Features
- **Core Data Structures**: 
  - `Light`, `Scene`, `Color`, `State`, `Group`, `Location`, `Product` structs
  - Configuration through `LifxConfig` struct
  - Error handling with custom `Error` type

- **Official API Support**:
  - List lights functionality
  - Set state (single and multiple)
  - State delta changes
  - Toggle power
  - Various lighting effects (Breathe, Move, Morph, Flame, Pulse)
  - Effects off command
  - Clean (HEV) functionality
  - List scenes
  - Color validation

- **Unofficial Offline API Support**:
  - List lights
  - Set state (single and multiple)

- **LAN Protocol Support** (in `lan.rs`):
  - Low-level message types for LIFX LAN protocol
  - UDP broadcast discovery
  - Protocol frame encoding/decoding
  - Basic test coverage for protocol messages

### API Design
- Both synchronous and asynchronous methods available
- Flexible configuration with multiple API endpoints support
- Builder pattern for state objects
- Comprehensive error handling

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- `serde` & `serde_json` for JSON serialization
- `reqwest` for HTTP requests (with blocking support)
- `trust-dns-resolver` for DNS resolution
- `byteorder` for protocol byte manipulation
- `thiserror` for error handling

### Architecture
- Main library interface in `lib.rs`
- LAN protocol implementation in `lan.rs`
- Both sync and async API methods
- Support for multiple API endpoints (official and unofficial)

## Recent Work Completed
- ✅ Examined project structure and documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation files (project_description.md, overview.md, todo.md)
- ✅ Added 35 unit tests for all major structs and functions in lib.rs
- ✅ Fixed bug in `string_vec_to_params` function (count variable was not being incremented)
- ✅ All unit tests passing (35/35 tests pass)
- ✅ Ran clippy linter and identified code quality improvements

## Test Coverage Added
- Light struct creation and methods
- State, StateDelta structs
- All effect structs (BreatheEffect, PulseEffect, MorphEffect, FlameEffect, MoveEffect, EffectsOff)
- Scene and Color structs
- LifxConfig and LifxResults
- Utility functions (string_vec_to_params)
- LAN protocol tests (10 tests already existing, all passing)

## Known Issues
- 55 failing doctests in lib.rs (example code needs updating)
- Multiple clippy warnings (mostly style issues like unnecessary returns)
- Two TODO comments in code for future improvements:
  - Support unlimited api_endpoints
  - Use multithreaded timeout for faster API failure detection

## Next Steps
- Fix failing doctests by updating example code
- Address clippy warnings for cleaner code
- Add integration tests with mock HTTP server
- Complete partially implemented features noted in TODOs
